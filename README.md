# CPP MODULES

C++ is a high-level language: when you write a program in it, the shorthands are suﬃciently expressive that you don’t need to worry about the details of processor instructions. C++ does give access to some lower-level functionality than other languages (e.g. memory addresses).

This assignment is composed of 9 modules (C00 through C08), each module coering one concept or more in C++.
