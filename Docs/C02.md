# Why we need a Canonical Class Form ?
Whenever a class is containing pointers to block of memory in the heap, Copying objects instantiated from that class either by the default copy constructor or the default copy assignment operator are both inadequate. So supplying our class with four conventional member functions, would be beneficial to reach a sufficient copy control. These four member functions are:
* A Constructor 
* A Destructor
* A Copy Constructor
* A Copy Assignment Operator

## What is a Copy Constructor ??

Whenever our code contains a set of instructions that requires the creation of a copy of our objects the copy constructor gets called. Well this copy constructor is not alwasys defined by the programmer, there's a so-called synthesized copy constructor that the compiler synthesize and it's known of yielding a shallow copy. This shallow copy does not always satisfy our needs and hence the definition of a copy constructor is crucial.

One of those lines of code that requires the creation of copy, the following:
* Initializing an object through the "=" operator with another object of the same type.
* Returning a given object from a function.
* or passing an object to a function.

Just by playing around with some cpp code we can observe, that: 
If we have declared a copy constructor inside our class, and we don't define it, a case of the ones above yields a compilation error telling that `Undefined Refrence to [copy constructor prototype]`. When in fact, the absence of a declared copy constructor will compile flawlessly. The thing is that the compiler will synthesize a **Default Copy Constructor**. 

A call to the copy constructor will always have place, when the creation of copy has place. But we some distinguish different cases here:
### The absence of a defined copy constructor:
There'll be a call to the default copy constructor, which will give birth of a shallow copy. This copying procedure will be flawed, for instance in the presence of a dynamic allocation of memory, just the pointers get copied and not their emplacement in the memory, the first issue to care about is the occurence of a *double free* while destroying the object.
### The existence of a defined copy constructor:
From our code we can define a copy constructor, it is a public member function that has the same name as the constructor, that takes a const or nonconst reference to the object it's copying. This time there's no shallow copy, the defined copy constructor takes care of all the job. Setting this member function to private will cause compilation errors.

## Comments:
> C++ imposes that the sole argument of the copy constructor is passed by reference. This makes sense as passing by value will issue a call to the copy constructor itself so this declaration : Student( Student ) is incorrect.

> Knowing that a copy constructor can have both prototypes *Student( Student &)* and *Student (const Student &)* and could both have place inside a class. All in all, a copy constructor will usualy be reading the object it's copying and it will not overwrite the object. So it fully makes sense that the sole argument of this constructor to be a const reference.

## What is a Copy Assignment Operator : 
A copy assignment operator is a function that controls how objects of its class are assigned, This operator is used whenever we proceed for assignment of an object with another object of the same class. Similarly to the copy constructor if we did not **overload** the "=" operator the compiler will generate automatically a **synthesized copy assignment operator**. This synthesized opearator assing an object to another one by copying the value of each member to the corresponding member in the other object. Well, how a copy assignment operator is declared inside a class ? In fact the common used 
expression for this operation is called **Overloading an Operator**. 


## What are Overloaded Operators ? 
Generally, **Overloaded Operators** are just another member function named `operator[operatorSymbol]` for example `operator=`, that redefine or let's say reshape the behavior of an operator such us "=, []...". The operands of the operator constitute the parameters of this function, being a member function, the left-hand operand is bound to the implicit *this* parameter, the right-hand operand is passed explicitly as a parameter.

> What Does mean memberwise copy ??
> A memberwise copy is a copy that requires an intimate knowledge of the structure of the data that it's being copied.
 
> Reminder: a const qualifier at the end of a member function is a promise that this would not change the state of the object, it's called on.

# Fixed-Point An Overwhelming Topic:
In general, floating point math offers a wider range of numbers and more precision than fixed point math. A fundamental difference between the two is the location of the decimal point, fixed-point numbers have the decimal point in a fixed position.
Fixed point number have a certain number of reserved digits that are on the left-side of the decimal for the integer portion of the number, the number to the right of the decimal point are reserved for the fractional portion of the number.
In the fixed-point representation, the fraction is often represented in the same number base as the integer part, but using negative powers of the base *b*. If n fraction digits are stored, the value will always be an integer multiple of b<sup color="blue">-n</sup>. 

<!-- ## What is the problem concerning representing Real Numbers in Computers ??  -->
## Accuracy Vs Precision --> Integers vs Floating point numbers
Accuracy referes to how close the measurment is to the true value.
Precision has to do with how much information you have about a quantity, how uniquely you have it pinned down.
Integers cannot keep track of the fractional part, dividing 5 or 4 by 2 will both yield 2. Whereas, for example an integer that is equal to 6 is undisputably 6 at the dot.
So we could say that integers gain in terms of accuracy but lack precision.
In the other hand, floating point are very precise, since they never delibrately discard informations representing your numbers, but floating point have poor accuracy. 
We could say that integers and floating-point numbers are different in terms that not every fraction can be represented in binary, meanwhile we could represent any integer in binary. The cause is not the base two, this could be noticeable even in base 10 for example 1/3. 

Real numbers cannot be represented accurately in a fixed space, when operating with floating-point numbers the result may not be fully represented with the required precision. This inaccuracy ends up with an information loss.

## The Assignment we have 
Firstly we should create a constructor that takes in a const integer number and converts it the corresponding fixed-point value. Well this is achievable by shifting the given integer number to the left by a specified amount of bit, in our case we have an attribute named `fractionalBits` storing this amount which is 8. But wait why would we do so ?? 
In fact, our class named Fixed is deviced to represent a fixed-point number, that is designating 8 bits for the fractional part in its bitstring. Well before explaining what does this mean, let's discuss What the naming refers to :
We actually assume that there is an imaginary binary point that seperates the integer from the fractional part, the position of this binary point is **FIXED** hence the naminng, and it's indicating how many bits were attributed to represent the integer part, and how many for the fractional part. For example a binary point fixed on the 3rd bit will let us with 2 bits for the fractional part, if it is fixed on the least significant bit we will be left with 0 bit s for the fraction and in this case it'll be an ordinary integer. In this regards integers are just a special case of the fixed-point.
Back to our question. Shifting a given number to the left by a given amounts of bit will indeed magnify its value, so it'll change. However having in mind the imaginary fixed binary point position we could interpret this number for our own needs.
