## How A Derived Class Knows its Base Classes
We could specify to our derived class, its base classes by adding a **class derivation list**, which is colon followed by comma-serparated list of base classes, each of which may have an optional **access specifier**. For instance :
    class Camel: public Animal, public Transporter {...}
By having `public`as the access specifier we could use the derived class as if its the base class.

## Member functions And Inheritance
Generally derived Classes inherits members of their base class. Despite of that a derived class can redefine operations that are type dependent, this redefinition is called **overriding**.
A derived class should declare members that it will override.
One thing to mention is that an **access specifier** determines whether users of a derived class are allowed to know that the derived class inherits from its base class.
when the deriviation is public, public members of the base class become part of the interface of the derived class. Moreover we can bind an object of a derived type to a reference or a pointer of the base class. Ordinarily classes inherits directly from only one base class, this is called **single inheritance**.

## Derived Class Constructors
Derived class objects have inherited members, but they cannot initialized them immediately. A derived class must use a base class constructor to initialize its base-class part. Likewise to how the initialization of members is done, a derived-class constructor rely on its constructor initializer list to pass arguments to a base-class constructor. A scope of a derived class is nested in the scope of its base class. Hence there is no difference between a member of a derived uses members defined in its own class, and how it uses members defined in its base.
