# Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Class and Interface

## Subtype Polymorphism:
Subtype polymorphism is making a subclass able to be used in where its super class is expected. C++ allows a reference or a pointer to an object of a base class to refer to an object of a derived class, it allows **implicit upcasts** which are conversions going upward of the inheritance hierarchy.
